# DCT-Vaaman: AAN-based Discrete Cosine Transform Integrated with RAH

## üìñ Overview
This project implements an **8-point 1D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)** using the  
**AAN (Arai‚ÄìAgui‚ÄìNakajima) method**, integrated with the **RAH** on FPGA.

## üßÆ About the AAN Method

The **AAN (Arai‚ÄìAgui‚ÄìNakajima) method** is a fast algorithm for computing the 
**8-point Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**.  

### üîë Key Advantages:
Traditional DCT implementations require many multiplications, which are costly in FPGA  
or ASIC designs. The AAN method simplifies the computation by factoring and reusing  
common terms, **reducing the number of multiplications dramatically**.

## ‚ö° Features
- 8-point 1D DCT (scalable to 2D for image transforms).
- Based on **AAN algorithm**: eliminates multipliers.
- Pipelined design for performance.

## üìä Resource Utilization (with RAH)

| Resource         | Usage   |
|------------------|---------|
| LUTs             | 34,660  |
| Memory Blocks    | 69      |
| Multipliers      | 0       |


## üöÄ Performance

- **Clock Frequency**: 70 MHz  
- **Pipeline Latency**: 44 cycles

## üìù Test Scripts

To validate the **8-point 1D DCT (AAN method)** design, two C scripts are provided:

### 1. Interactive Decimal Input
- Allows the user to manually enter **8 decimal numbers** (corresponding to the 8-point DCT input).
- The script computes and displays the DCT output for the given values.

**Example Run:**
```bash
$ gcc dct.c -o dct
$ ./dct 52, 55, 61, 66, 70, 61, 64, 73
```

### 2. File-based Input/Output
   - Reads an **input file** containing `512` frames, each with **8 decimal input values**.
   - Automatically computes the DCT for all frames and generates an **output file** containing `512` corresponding DCT outputs.

   **Example Run:**
```bash
$ gcc dct_file.c -o dct_file
$ ./dct_file input.txt output.txt
```
These scripts make it easier to test the hardware design with both **custom single-frame inputs** and **batch test vectors**.

### 3.RAHComm Input (Hexadecimal Frames)
   -  If you want to provide inputs via rahcomm, send the data as 32-bit numbers.
   -  Each frame consists of 8 values, and each value is given in IEEE-754 floating-point (hex) format.

   **Example (one frame with 8 values)**:
   ```
   00 00 42 92 00 00 
   00 00 42 80 00 00
   00 00 42 74 00 00
   00 00 42 8c 00 00 
   00 00 42 84 00 00 
   00 00 42 74 00 00 
   00 00 42 5c 00 00 
   00 00 42 50 00 00
   ```
   Each line represents one 32-bit number in a frame.
   8 such numbers together form one complete input frame.
